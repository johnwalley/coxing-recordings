# Coxing Recordings

Website for www.coxing.co.uk - a curated collection of coxswain recordings from prestigious rowing competitions around the world.

## About

This site showcases audio and video recordings from coxswains during competitive rowing races. Coxswains are responsible for steering the boat and motivating the crew, and these recordings provide insight into race strategy, calls, and the intensity of competitive rowing.

The collection includes recordings from:
- Henley Royal Regatta
- World Rowing Championships
- BUCS Regattas
- Metropolitan Regatta
- Head of the River Race
- And other international competitions

Each recording features detailed information about the race, year, competing crews, and the coxswain.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with pnpm:

```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build for production:

```bash

```

Format code:

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
