## Getting Started

Install dependencies with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Format code:

```bash
pnpm format
```

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
