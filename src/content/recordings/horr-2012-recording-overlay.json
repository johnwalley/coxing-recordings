  "description": "Here it is - some video, a few photos, and a recording. Taking a 2nd VIII to the highest placing second boat at the Head of the River Race, and inside the top 10 at 9th position. It was a fantastic row, passing 5 other crews, by an unprecedented crew. I must say, it was the most fun I've had racing the Tideway, and am very proud of the 8 other guys that helped me accomplish it. Enjoy",
